    <h1><b>Surveying</b></h1>
    <h2>Road survey</h2>
    <p> 
        In the preliminary design phase, we conduct comprehensive surveys to gather essential data for the initial road designs, considering factors such as alignment, elevation, and drainage. Alignment involves determining the optimal path for the road, taking into account terrain, existing infrastructure, and environmental impact. Elevation assessment ensures a smooth gradient and safe driving conditions, while effective drainage planning prevents water accumulation and ensures the road's longevity. Moving to the detailed design phase, we create thorough engineering designs, including cross-sections, profiles, and construction plans for the Balam Area in Pokhara. Cross-sections provide detailed views of the road's different material layers and their thickness, while profiles illustrate the road's elevation changes over its length. The construction plans encompass comprehensive specifications and instructions necessary for building the road, ensuring a clear and structured approach to the construction process.

<h2>Detail Topographic Survey</h2>
<p>A detailed topographic survey has been meticulously conducted for the Research & Innovation Center (RIC) at Pashchimanchal Campus. This comprehensive survey involved a thorough examination of the area's natural and man-made features, including elevations, contours, and existing infrastructure. The primary goal was to capture accurate and precise data that reflects the current terrain and landscape. Using advanced surveying equipment and techniques, every aspect of the site was measured and recorded, from the smallest undulations in the land to significant structural elements. This detailed topographic survey is crucial for various phases of planning and development, providing a solid foundation for future design and construction projects. The collected data will aid in ensuring that any new developments are well-integrated into the existing environment, addressing potential challenges related to elevation changes and drainage. This meticulous approach helps in creating sustainable and efficient designs that align with the campus's vision for growth and innovation.</p>

<h2>Cadastral & Hydropower Survey</h2>
<p>A comprehensive detailed survey has been conducted for the preparation of a cadastral map sheet, which is essential for accurately documenting property boundaries, land ownership, and other legal land descriptions. This detailed work involved precise measurements and mapping to ensure that all cadastral information is accurately represented, aiding in legal matters, land disputes, and development planning. Additionally, a detailed feasibility topographic survey has been carried out for the construction of a hydropower plant in the Armala area of Pokhara. This survey is vital for assessing the site's suitability for such a large-scale infrastructure project. It involves evaluating the terrain, identifying potential environmental impacts, and determining the best location for various components of the hydropower plant. The topographic data collected helps in understanding the land's contours and elevation changes, which are crucial for the design and construction phases of the hydropower project. By integrating this detailed topographic information, planners and engineers can create a more efficient and sustainable design that maximizes energy production while minimizing environmental disruption.

    <h1>WebGIS, ArcGIS & QGIS </h1>
<p>I have actively participated in several GIS and WebGIS training programs organized by GESAN and NAXA, focusing on the utilization of ArcGIS and QGIS software for cartographic applications. These training sessions provided invaluable hands-on experience and theoretical knowledge essential for proficient spatial data management and analysis. Through these programs, I acquired advanced skills in creating and manipulating geographic data, performing spatial analysis, and producing high-quality maps for diverse applications. The training also emphasized the integration of GIS technologies with web-based platforms, enhancing my ability to develop interactive and accessible mapping solutions. By gaining expertise in both ArcGIS and QGIS, I have strengthened my proficiency in geospatial data visualization, modeling, and problem-solving, preparing me to effectively contribute to projects requiring spatial information management and analysis. These experiences have not only expanded my technical capabilities but also deepened my understanding of the role of GIS in addressing complex geographical challenges and supporting informed decision-making across various sectors.</p>
    <h1>OSM Mapping</h1>
    <p>I actively participated as a Digital Geodata volunteer during a 7-day Mapathon event organized by NAXA, where I contributed to the digitization of critical resources and elements at risk in OpenStreetMap (OSM) using the HOT Task Manager. This event was a significant opportunity to leverage my mapping skills and geographic information expertise to support humanitarian efforts and disaster risk reduction initiatives. Through collaborative mapping efforts, we aimed to enhance the availability of accurate geospatial data crucial for planning, response, and resilience-building in vulnerable regions. My involvement in this Mapathon underscored my commitment to using geospatial technology for social good and community empowerment, aligning with the mission of NAXA to harness spatial data for sustainable development and disaster preparedness.

        Additionally, I participated in the VICTORY Mapathon organized by the Institute of Himalayan Risk Reduction (IHRR) and SmartPhones For Water (S4W Nepal), with support from ADPC, where I was recognized as one of the top five mappers. This event focused on mapping water resources and related infrastructure, addressing critical needs for water management and disaster mitigation strategies in Nepal. My contributions during this Mapathon involved mapping essential geographic features and updating information on water availability, which are vital for improving access to clean water and enhancing disaster resilience in local communities. By collaborating with experts and fellow volunteers, I gained valuable insights into the practical applications of geospatial data in addressing environmental challenges and supporting sustainable development goals. These experiences have deepened my passion for geospatial technology and motivated me to continue contributing to mapping initiatives that make a meaningful impact on people's lives and the environment.
