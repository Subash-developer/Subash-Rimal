    <h1>On Going Projects</h1>
    <p><b><h3>1.Enhancing Utility Management through WebGIS and Metric House 
        Numbering in Annapurna Rural Municipality Ward No. 10 ,</b></h3>
    <br>The ongoing project titled "Enhancing Utility Management through WebGIS and Metric House Numbering in Annapurna Rural Municipality Ward No. 10" aims to revolutionize the management and delivery of public utilities by leveraging advanced geographic information systems (GIS) and implementing a systematic metric house numbering system. The project focuses on Ward No. 10 of the Annapurna Rural Municipality, where the existing utility management infrastructure faces significant challenges in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and accessibility. By integrating WebGIS technology, the project seeks to create a dynamic and interactive map that provides real-time data on utility networks, such as water supply, electricity, and waste management. This map will enable local authorities to monitor and manage these utilities more effectively, ensuring timely maintenance and reducing service interruptions. Additionally, the introduction of metric house numbering will standardize addresses within the ward, facilitating easier navigation for residents, emergency services, and delivery personnel. The combination of WebGIS and metric house numbering is expected to enhance overall urban planning, improve service delivery, and contribute to the sustainable development of the community.</p><br>
    <p><b><h3>2.Forest fire risk mapping using analytical hierarchy process (AHP) 
        and earth observation datasets: a case study of Kaski District.b</h3></b> <br>The project "Forest Fire Risk Mapping using Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Earth Observation Datasets: A Case Study of Kaski District" aims to assess and mitigate the risks associated with forest fires in the Kaski District. By employing the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), a structured technique for organizing and analyzing complex decisions, the project evaluates various factors contributing to fire risk, such as vegetation type, topography, and climate conditions. These factors are integrated with Earth observation datasets, including satellite imagery and remote sensing data, to produce a comprehensive risk map. This map highlights areas with varying levels of fire susceptibility, enabling authorities to prioritize regions for fire prevention and resource allocation. The project not only enhances the understanding of fire dynamics in the Kaski District but also provides a valuable tool for proactive management and response strategies, ultimately aiming to protect both the environment and local communities from the devastating impacts of forest fires.
